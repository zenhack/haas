This document describes the installation and setup of HaaS on CentOS 6.5.
HaaS should work on other distros, but is not well tested or supported.
For development environments, see ``HACKING.rst``. Either SQLite or MySQL may be
used for the database; the procedure for each is described here.

The HaaS Service node
=====================

This section talks about what must be done on the server upon which HaaS runs.

Prerequisite Software
---------------------

HaaS requires a number of packages available through the CentOS RPM
repositories, as well as the EPEL repository. EPEL can be enabled via:

::

    yum install epel-release

Then, the rest of the packages can be installed via:

::

    yum install libvirt bridge-utils ipmitool telnet httpd mod_wsgi python-pip qemu-kvm python-virtinst

If using the SQLite database backend, you'll also need to install sqlite:

::

    yum install sqlite

If using the MySQL, you'll need:

::

    yum install mysql-server MySQL-python

In addition, HaaS depends on a number of python libraries. Many of these are
available as RPMs as well, but we recommend installing them with pip, since
this will install the versions that HaaS has been tested with.  This is done
automatically by the instructions below.

First, HaaS depends on a utility library called moc-rest. It can be installed
via:

::

    git clone https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-rest
    cd moc-rest
    sudo python setup.py install

The HaaS software can then be installed similarly:

::

    git clone https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas
    cd haas
    sudo python setup.py install

SELinux
-------

The setup described below runs into problems with SELinux when using the SQLite
database. For now the recommended solution is to disable SELinux when using
SQLite.

::

    sudo setenforce 0

Also make sure SELinux is also disabled on startup. Edit `/etc/selinux/config`
setting:

::

    SELINUX=permisive

This is not necessary when using MySQL.

Create User
-----------

First create a system user ``haas_user`` with::

  sudo useradd haas_user -d /var/lib/haas -m -r

haas.cfg
--------

HaaS is configured with ``haas.cfg``. This file contains settings for both the
CLI client and the server. Carefully read the file ``haas.cfg.example`` (at
the top of the source tree), to understand and correctly set all of the
options.  In particular, the following two fields in the ``headnode`` section
are very important: ``trunk_nic`` must match your choice of trunk NIC in the
"Networking - Bridges" instructions below; ``base_imgs`` must match the name
of the base headnode libvirt instance created in the "Libvirt" instructions
below.

The file should be placed at ``/etc/haas.cfg``; The ``haas.wsgi``
script, described below, requires this. Awkwardly, the ``haas``
command line tool expects the file to be present in its current
working directory. This will be fixed in the next release, but for
now, put the file in ``/etc`` and create a symlink to it in the
HaaS user's home directory::

  sudo ln -s /etc/haas.cfg /var/lib/haas/

It should be noted that HaaS end users will also require a ``haas.cfg`` file
in their local directory in order to communicate with the HaaS server.
However, creating another symlink to the ``/etc/haas.cfg`` exposes sensitive
administrative information to users, such as usernames and passwords. To
avoid this, users should have their own copy of ``haas.cfg`` that is stripped
of all sections except for the ``[client]`` section.  Additionally, the
``/etc/haas.cfg`` should have its permissions set to read-only and ownership
set to the ``haas_user``::

  sudo chown haas_user:haas_user /etc/haas.cfg
  sudo chmod 400 /etc/haas.cfg

All HaaS commands in these instructions should be run in this directory::

  cd /var/lib/haas

Networking - Bridges
--------------------

Currently HaaS only supports one mechanism for layer-2 isolation: 802.1q VLANs.
One NIC on the HaaS host is designated the "trunk NIC".  All network traffic to
headnode VMs in HaaS is routed through this trunk NIC, on a tagged VLAN.  As
such, the port on the switch that this NIC connects to must have all of HaaS's
VLANs trunked to it.  Currently, this configuration must be done manually.

HaaS uses Linux bridges to route the traffic from the trunk NIC to the
headnodes. Currently the bridges and VLAN NICs for this must be created
ahead of time.  The provided script ``create_bridges`` will create bridges
for all VLANS in the allocation pool. It must be run in the directory that
contains ``haas.cfg``. This pre-allocation is easier to reason about
than on-demand creation, and allows HaaS to be run as an unprivileged user,
but it also causes some limitations.  For instance, because of this, headnodes
can only be connected to networks with allocated VLANs.  The bridges must also
be pre-allocated again on each boot. For now, the recomended approach is to add::

  (cd /etc && create_bridges)

to the end of ``/etc/rc.local``.

HaaS must additionally have IP connectivity to the switch's administration
console.  Right now the only mechanism for connecting to the switch is via
telnet (with `plans <https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas/issues/46>`_ to support
ssh). As such, the administration console should only be accessible through a
trusted private network.

Libvirt
-------

We must reconfigure ``libvirt`` to allow (some) unprivileged users access to
the system QEMU session.  To do this, edit ``/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf`` and
uncomment the following lines::

  unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
  auth_unix_ro = "none"
  auth_unix_rw = "none"

Then create the group 'libvirt' and add the HaaS user to that group::

  sudo groupadd libvirt
  sudo gpasswd libvirt -a haas_user

Finally, restart ``libvirt`` with::

  sudo service libvirtd restart
  
You should also set libvirt to start on boot::

  sudo chkconfig libvirtd on

Headnode image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now we must make a clonable base headnode.  (One is required, and more are
allowed.)  First create a storage pool.  Any kind can be used, but we will only
document creating a directory-backed storage pool::

  virsh --connect qemu:///system pool-define pool.xml

where ``pool.xml`` contains a description of the pool::

  <pool type="dir">
    <name>haas_headnodes</name>
    <target>
      <path>/var/lib/libvirt/images</path>
    </target>
  </pool>

The directory specified by path must already exist, and be readable and
writable by the ``libvirt`` user. Then activate the pool, and make the it
activate on boot, with::

  virsh --connect qemu:///system pool-start haas_headnodes
  virsh --connect qemu:///system pool-autostart haas_headnodes

The scripts in ``examples/ubuntu-headnode`` can be used to build an ubuntu
14.04 disk image with a default root password. Read the README in that
directory for more information.

Once the disk image is built, copy ito the storage pool directory (here we
assume it is caled ``base.img``)::

  mv base.img /var/lib/libvirt/images/

Finally, create the base headnode with::

  virsh --connect qemu:///system define base.xml

where ``base.xml`` contains a description of the headnode::

  <domain type='kvm'>
    <name>base</name>
    <memory>524288</memory>
    <os>
      <type arch='x86_64'>hvm</type>
      <boot dev='hd'/>
    </os>
    <features>
      <acpi/><apic/><pae/>
    </features>
    <clock offset="utc"/>
    <on_poweroff>destroy</on_poweroff>
    <on_reboot>restart</on_reboot>
    <on_crash>restart</on_crash>
    <vcpu>1</vcpu>
    <devices>
      <emulator>/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm</emulator>
      <disk type='file' device='disk'>
        <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
        <source file='/var/lib/libvirt/images/base.img'/>
        <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
      </disk>
      <interface type='network'>
        <source network='default'/>
        <model type='virtio'/>
      </interface>
      <input type='tablet' bus='usb'/>
      <graphics type='vnc'/>
      <console type='pty'/>
      <sound model='ac97'/>
      <video>
        <model type='cirrus'/>
      </video>
    </devices>
  </domain>

Note that the above specifies the format of the disk image as ``raw``; if
you're using an image in another format (such as ``qcow``) you will have
to adjust this.

Many of these fields are probably not needed, but we have not thouroughly
tested which ones. Furthermore, this set of XML duplicates the path to
storage directory; this seems unnecessary.

Users may find the scripts in ``examples/puppet_headnode`` useful for
configuring the ubuntu headnode to act as a PXE server; see the README in
that directory for more information.

Database
--------

If using mysql, you need to start the database server (and enable it on boot):

::

  service mysqld start
  chkconfig mysqld on

Then, log in to the database server::

  mysql -u root -p
 
and execute::

  CREATE DATABASE haas_db;
  CREATE USER haas_db_user IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  GRANT ALL ON haas_db.* TO haas_db_user;

Substituting your own values for `haas_db`, `haas_db_user`, and `password`. Make
sure these are the same as the values in `haas.cfg`.

We *strongly* recommend configuring MySQL for "traditional" mode; MySQL does
very little sanity checking by default.

If using SQLite, make sure `haas.cfg` specifies a path to the database that is
readable and writable by the user that HaaS will run as.

With all DBMSes, the following command must be used to initialize the
database:

::

  haas init_db

If using SQLite, this must be run as the HaaS user.

Running the Server under Apache
-------------------------------

HaaS consists of two services: an API server and a networking server. The
former is a WSGI application, which we recommend running with Apache's
``mod_wsgi``. Create a file ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf``, with the contents::

  LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
  WSGISocketPrefix run/wsgi
  
  <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
    ServerName 127.0.0.1
    AllowEncodedSlashes On
    WSGIDaemonProcess haas_user user=haas_user group=haas_user threads=2
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/haas/haas.wsgi
    <Directory /var/www/haas>
      WSGIProcessGroup haas_user
      WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
      Order deny,allow
      Allow from all
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

(The file may already exist, with just the ``LoadModule`` option. If so, it is
safe to replace it.)

**Note:** certain calls to HaaS such as *port_register()* may pass arbitrary
strings that should be escaped (see `issue 361 <https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas/issues/360>`_). By default, Apache `Doesn't
allow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4390436/need-to-allow-encoded-slashes-on-apache>`_
this due to security concerns. ``AllowEncodedSlashes On`` enables the passing
of these arguments. If your Apache version is 2.2.18 or later (released in May, 2011, though not included with CentOS 6.5), you should
replace ``AllowEncodedSlashes On`` with ``AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode``, which
is safer for the long term (see `the
docs <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#AllowEncodedSlashes>`_ for
more information).

If you haven't already, create the directory that will contain the HaaS WSGI module::

 sudo mkdir /var/www/haas/

Copy the file ``haas.wsgi`` from the top of the haas source tree to the
location indicated by the ``WSGIScriptAlias`` option. The virtual host and
server name should be set according to the hostname (and port) by which clients
will access the api. Then, restart Apache::

  sudo service httpd restart

You should also set apache to start on boot::

  sudo chkconfig httpd on

The networking server may be started by running::

  haas serve_networks &

as the HaaS user. To make this happen on boot, add the following to ``/etc/rc.local``::

  (cd /var/lib/haas && su haas_user -c 'haas serve_networks') &

Congratulations- at this point, you should have a functional HaaS service running!

Describe datacenter resources
=============================

For HaaS to do anything useful, you must use the HaaS API to populate the
database with information about the resources in your datacenter -- chiefly
nodes, their NICs and the ports to which those NICs are attached. These are
the relevant API calls:

- ``node_register``
- ``node_delete``
- ``node_register_nic``
- ``node_delete_nic``
- ``port_register``
- ``port_delete``
- ``port_connect_nic``
- ``port_detach_nic``
