def no_dry_run(f):
    """A decorator which "disables" a function during a dry run.

    A can specify a `dry_run` option in the `devel` section of `haas.cfg`.
    If the option is present (regardless of its value), any function or
    method decorated with `no_dry_run` will be "disabled." The call will
    be logged (with level `logging.DEBUG`), but will not actually execute.
    The function will instead return 'None'.  Callers of decorated functions
    must accept a None value gracefully.

    The intended use case of `no_dry_run` is to disable functions which
    cannot be run because, for example, the HaaS is executing on a
    developer's workstation, which has no configured switch, libvirt, etc.

    If the `dry_run` option is not specified, this decorator has no effect.
